#Version 5.1.0:
## Features
  * *PR #399, #406, #408, #410: Updates for E3SM workflow to support online remapping computation for climate applications through interfaces to TempestRemap library. 
     Major additions to expose online remapping capabilities by computing exact intersection between unstructured meshes on a sphere, and providing 
     projection weight operator computation through interfaces to TempestRemap for both scalar and vector solution fields with conservation and/or 
     monotonicity constraints. While the primary application target is E3SM for this particular feature addition, the bulk of the interfaces added
     in this PR can be reused in other coupled physics simulations as well.
  * *PR #403: Updates to Cython file generation process in PyMOAB.
     We’ve done away with static `.cpp` files in the project and are now relying on users having a Cython installation greater than 0.26 on their machine. 
     This helps us with python 2/3 compatibility issues as well as superfluous re-compiles of libraries.
## Enhancements
  * *PR #376, #365: Updates to PyMOAB to improve the Cython interaction and Python3 compatability.
  * *PR #397: Consistent CMake configurations for downstream apps
  * *PR #404: Update RTT reader to support v1.0.1 specs
  * *PR #391, #401: Delete volume/surface OBB trees and restore OBBs from file
  * *PR #370: Several improvements in the GeomTopoTool implementation
## Fixes
  * *PR #363, #398: PyMOAB tag and skinner test fixes
  * *PR #364: CMake configuration updates to not always require Fortran for BLAS/LAPACK linkage
  * *PR #362: Several semantic and memory leak fixes due to Coverity, cppcheck and valgrind
  * *PR #364, #366, #368, #373, #374, #375, #379, #381, #382, #384, #387, #388, #389, #400, #407, #409: Several miscellaneous configuration updates for both autotools and CMake workflows
#Version 5.0.0:
## Features
  * *PR #248, #290, #299*: Eigen3, BLAS/LAPACK -- Add support for the Eigen3 BLAS/LAPACK header libraries; Now BLAS/LAPACK are required dependencies for MOAB in order to support high-performance dense solver support for various algorithms
  * *PR #278, #286, #280, #296, #300, #325, #326, #332, #331, #334, #335, #317, #345, #346, #353, #356*: PyMOAB -- This interface now directly exposes Python modules to access common MOAB functionality in order to load, query and manipulate structured/unstructured meshes in memory. It also includes interfaces to some specific classes such as the ScdInterface and its associated classes along with the TopoUtil tool. We have also added support for Tags, Range, Skinner modules that can be used to build more advanced capabilities as needed. Currently, this interface only supports serial configuration and we intend to support parallelism through `mpi4py` dependencies in the next release. Several useful tests and examples have also been added for users to get started.
  * *PR #162*: Add capability to load an "*unpartitioned*" mesh file through a trivial partition with the parallel option: `PARALLEL=BCAST_DELETE;PARTITION=TRIVIAL`; This works for any mesh format and so we are no longer restricted to just our parallel h5m native mesh.
  * *PR #238*: Discrete Geometry Module -- Higher order curve and surface reconstruction strategies based on local polynomial fittings along with integrated support for recursive uniform refinement. 
  * *PR #318*: Add Mesquite optimization support to MOAB so that mesh optimization algorithms can be natively run on a MOAB mesh. It can also use the geometry information when MOAB is configured with CGM (through Lasso relational databases in MOAB). 
  * *PR #330*: Add support for computing high-order, conservative, multi-mesh projection weights with the **TempestRemap** library. Several optimizations have been implemented for the advancing-front algorithm to compute the intersections between two unstructured meshes on a sphere. In addition to this, the integration with Tempest library enables computation of the projection weights between FV/cGLL/dGLL discretizations seamlessly in a scalable fashion, even though Tempest itself is a serial library!
  * *PR #288*: HEX8 (linear) to HEX27 (quadratic) mesh conversion utility
## Enhancements
  * *PR #263*: Support for building with CGM build directory (instead of installation) to ease SIGMA workflows
  * *PR #267*: Modify scale and reflect signature in FBiGeom, now it conforms to iGeom
  * *PR #266*: Update Matrix3 constructor
  * *PR #143*: The original design of MOAB Core was responsible for initializing MPI (if the user / driver forgot to do it in a parallel setting). However, this is just bad design since after destruction of moab::Core object, and hence call to MPI_Finalize(), no other MPI calls could be made. This design has now been fixed and MPI_Init and MPI_Finalize should now be called in user driver code.
  * *PR #287*: Code fails gracefully when number of ranks are greater than number of parts in loaded h5m file
  * *PR #276*: iMOAB extensions to create and manipulate vertices in addition to querying entities and tags on the mesh

               - various performance and API improvements
               - Completely remove the DagMC tool from MOAB since the bulk of the capabilities are now exposed through other native classes in MOAB directly.
               - Implement context for determining whether ray intersections are counted
               - Add a method to GeomTopoTool to recover the topology of a geometry of nested volumes when the file does not contain this information
  * *PR #311*: Update Debian dependencies.
  * *PR #308*: `mbconvert` tool can now include the MPAS (graph) partition data during conversion

# Version 3.0.0 (SVN tag 3.0.0):
- Updated QVDual to work with new versions of VTK and removed
dependence on graphviz
- Move ITAPS/TSTT interface implementation into tools/iMesh and make
it work with configure system
- Implement new version number system
- Incorporate DagMC library (does fast facet-based
ray tracing) into tools/dagmc
- Prefer g++ to pgCC in configure scripts
- Many improvements in kd tree functionality, performance
- Move entity sets to be stored in sequences, better performance &
functionality
- Improved various file writers/readers, including:
. Better performance of HDF5 file reader
. Configuration with/without HDF5, netcdf
. Vtk writer improvements
- Added functions to MBInterface to get memory usage of MOAB
- Fixes to various MBCN functions for 64-bit builds
- Small changes to #defines of some tag names in MBTagConventions.hpp


# Version 2.00 (CVS tag version_200):
- New MBInterface method to get blocked coordinate data for vertices.
- Speed up reading of entity sets in .h5m files.
- Store sets in entity sequences
- Remove use of virtual functions from MBMeshSet
- Add API for quering total and break-down of memory use by MOAB.
- Add initial Adaptive kD-tree implementation.
- Add upper_bound method for MBRange.
- Make parallel configuration (MPI rank and size) per-MOAB-instance values,
  and add utility methods for querying/manipulating processor ID portion
  of entity handles.
- Fix allocation of handles such that they are allocated with the 
  correct processor ID for parallel 
- Remove MPI calls from MOAB constructor.  Make paralle config (MPI
  rank and size) arguments to the MOAB constuctor.
- Separate type definitions from interface definitions.  MBEntityType.h 
  contains the definition of MBEntityType and MBTypes.h contains the
  definitions of all other types and includes MBEntityType.h.  MBInterface 
  now includes MBTypes.h rather than MBCN.hpp so some applications using
  MBCN.hpp may have to add an explicit include.
- Add methods to MBRange to check if all contained entities are of a given
  type or dimension
- Change internal storage of entity set parent/child lists so that we have
  better behavior parent/child links become stale (don't try to delete/deref
  stale pointers.)
- Add lower_bound, upper_bound, equal_range methods that accept an MBEntityType
  as input to MBRange.
- Add front, back, pop_front and pop_back methods to MBRange
- Change internal MBRange::PairNode definition so that the 
  MBRange::const_pair_iterator::operator->() works correctly.
- Added 'bool' value to tag_create, defaulting to false.  When true, tag_create
  will return MB_SUCCESS if the tag already exists *and* matches the tag
  creation parameters.
- Fixed bugs saving/restoring of mesh and default values for tags containing 
  MBEntityHandles to/from HDF5 files.
- Allow special case null (zero) value for MBEntityHandle tags in HDF5 files
- Added processor rank to entity handle, right below entity type and above id
fields; width of this field is computed at initialization, and depends on the
number of processors being used.  On serial versions, zero bits are used so
handles are as before.
- Added option to specify requested start id and processor id when creating
a mesh set.
- Added functionality (in MBParallelComm class) for passing mesh between processors.
- Corrected set-related functions when inputting '0' (which is taken to mean 
the interface set, i.e. the whole mesh); in this case, one can't add parent/child
sets, but one can request them (return no sets in that case)
- Added functions to support tag semantics 
- Added num_hops argument for num_child_meshsets and num_parent_meshsets.
- Removed default value for default value in tag_create function (this
argument was making the choice between overloaded versions of this
function ambiguous)
- Fixed bug in MBCN::NumSubEntities when input d=0 (i.e. vertices)
- Changed arguments to get_connectivity to take const MBEntityHandle* and size
instead of std::vector, so single MBEntityHandle can be used as input
- Added version of get_connectivity which returns results in an MBRange, 
for convenience of calling code needing to do range-based logic
- Added std::string MBInterface::get_error_string(const MBErrorCode) const, which
returns a string for the error code passed in (usually just a string representation
of the error code enum)
- Added MBRange variants of get_parent_meshsets, get_child_meshsets
- Added list_entity function to MBInterface
- Fix bug writing global/default values for tags containing entity handles
   to HDF5 files when using 64-bit handles.
- Fix bugs in VTK I/O for structured mesh, polygons, quadratic elements, and
   bit tags.

# Version 1.01 (CVS tag version_101): 
##New Capabilities:
- Added support for polygons/polyhedra; polyhedra represented by
storing polygon handles as connectivity array, otherwise poly elements
similar to other entities in MOAB
- Added DualTool, to compute mesh dual, and for hex meshes, dual
surfaces/curves
- Added support for new HDF5-based native MOAB reader/writer; this is
the only format capable of storing any data represented in MOAB
- Added writers for GMV, SLAC, Vtk (limited), and also a template for
constructing new mesh writers WriteTemplate
- Added tools/converter tool for mesh format conversion to/from any of
the formats supported by MOAB
- Added support for dynamically adding readers/writers and dynamically
testing whether any in the list can read/write a given file; required
substantial additions to MBWriteUtil
- Added MBInterface::tag_get_default_value
- Added MBRange functions subtract, lowerBound, operator+=, operator-=
- Added rudimentary mesh joining capability, and a test for that to
MBTest
- Added "categories" tag, which represent broad category types on
entity sets; used e.g. to indicate a set represents geometric
vertex/edge/face/region, dual surface/curve, etc.; currently only
supported by .cub file reader

##Bug Fixes/Rearrangements:
- Fixed bug getting up-adjacencies from entities having equivalent entities; 
some adjacencies were being missed.
- Fixed a bug in set_connectivity, where old vertices were put on the
end of a scratch array instead of the beginning; symptom showed up as
old vertices still being adjacent to the element whose connectivity
was being set.
- Changed error returned when tag_delete_data called for entity which can't be found,
from MB_TAG_NOT_FOUND to MB_ENTITY_NOT_FOUND
- Fixed bug in tag_get_tags, where tag handles weren't passed back properly
- Improved efficiency of MOAB's TSTT mesh interface implementation in
various ways
- Extensive changes to performance tests (in test/perf) to test MOAB
performance compared to that of cubit and of MOAB TSTT mesh interface
- When requesting entities with a tag value equal to the (defined)
default value for that tag, entities not having a tag are returned in
the list
- Move conventional tag names from MBInterface.hpp into
MBTagConventions.hpp
- renamed MBCN::SubEntityConn to MBCN::SubEntityVertexIndices, and added
new function MBCN::SubEntityConn, which returns the actual
connectivity of a subentity given the parent connectivity, and the
subentity dimension and index

# Version 1.00: 
Initial release (woo-hoo!)
